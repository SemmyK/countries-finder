## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [react-tailwindcss-select](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tailwindcss-select) - For filtering countries by region

### What I learned

This project was great challenge to practice Next.js and TailwindCSS to build up the website.
I learn a little bit more about Images in Next.js and all the style possibilites with Tailwind.

### Continued development

I am planing to use this project to practice Jest and Docker also, since I started to learn testing and handling containers I believe this project will be perfect for practice.

### Useful resources

- My primary resources are always documentations websites, if that doesn't help then I turn to Google, YouTube, Stackoverflow or ChatGPT.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind dark/light mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTAJ-enfums) - This helped me to resolve hydratation issue that adding dark/light theme with package next-themes [npm next-theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes) was causing. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
